 


  Hello there! thanks for downloading!

  This is just a very simple template for spell and items cards, so there aren't 
  a lot of advices to give here, but to be sure:

   - the "empty back" files are there if you want the backside of the card to match the 
     frame of the front, but you are free to not use them, or to customize them how you 
     prefere, like with logos or other illustrations/symbols. 

   - for a better experience holding these cards in hand i recommend printing on thick 
     paper, or to attach the printed sheet onto thin cardboard and then cut all the cards. 
     that way at least will feel nice to hold. that said, i've put here the black and white
     files if you want to use normal paper and keep neat small reminder sheets around. 

   - the symbols on the spells cards are: the hourglass is duration, the crosshair is range, 
     A, BA and R are the casting time (action, bonus action and reaction), the C is for 
     concentration. 



  nothing more to say here, i hope you enjoy them, let me know!
